### Express note taker

This application can write, save, and delete notes files, storing them in a backend JSON file functioning as a database. 

This application is deployed using Heroku, and fully functional. You can use it here: https://express-notetaker-app.herokuapp.com/.  

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
node server
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
